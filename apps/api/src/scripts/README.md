# Seed Script

This seed script is intentionally **disabled** to avoid creating synthetic test data.

## Usage

```bash
cd apps/api
npm run seed
```

## What it does

- Prints a message and exits without creating any records.

## Notes

- If you need reference data initialization, add a separate minimal seed that does not create fake users/events/orders.
