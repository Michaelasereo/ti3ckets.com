# Legacy Express API

This folder contains the original Node.js/Express API that ran on port 8080.

**All APIs now run in Next.js** (apps/web) on port 3000. This Express app is kept for reference only. Standard development uses a single server:

- Run `npm run dev` from the repo root (starts Next.js only), or
- Run `./scripts/start-dev.sh`

No need to start this API server for normal development.
